# This script collects information on agents 
# deployed for the Alert Logic MDR solution across all
# deployments under a single customer account (CID) and
# outputs a CSV file that gives the agent name, the
# IDS sensor it is assigned to and the deployment name
# that it belongs to.
#
# To use this script pass it the Alert Logic customer ID (CID) as
# the one and only parameter. And provide the user name and password
# use to access the Alert Logic console.
# 
# Usage:
# mdr_agent_assignment <cid>
#
#
# Sample Output:
#
# ./mdr_agent_assignment.sh $cid
# Username: *****
# Password: *****
